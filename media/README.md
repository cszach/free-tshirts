### File format

Because The Free T-shirts Campaign :heart: free software, **SVG** (Scalable
Vector Graphics) is selected as the preferred file format for vector designs
here.

**SVG files must be plain SVG** (e.g. contains no software-specific tags or
attributes). If your vector graphics editor saves files in a custom format,
please export to plain SVG.

### Filename

Filenames of files in this folder must be in lowercase. Plain SVG files must end
with `.plain.svg`.

## Identity

The Free T-shirts Campaign has 3 graphical items for identification:
1. The logo
